    <h3>Do you and your partner resolve your disagreements?</h3>
    <p>If not you may be a good candidate for Resentment Reduction Therapy.</p>
    <h3>What is Resentment Reduction Therapy?</h3>
    <p>Traditional couples counseling typically focuses on improving communication
      skills, looking at how you talk to your spouse or the "problems" that you are having in your marriage.
      Resentment Reduction Therapy (RRT) addresses these issues as well as focusing on the behaviors that
      each member of the couple engages in that creates frustration, anger, and bitterness
      toward their mate. Only by identifying the source of the resentment (and how powerful each
      resentment generating behavior is) can individuals understand what behaviors they need
      to work on first. After understanding what each person needs to do to get their house in order
      and convince their partner that they can have hope of long and sustained change. Resentment Reduction
      Therapy also focuses on helping individuals understand the bheaviors they engage in that derail their arguments.
      This may mean yelling, rolling their eyes, interrupting, bringing things up from the past, etc. All of these behaviors
      can keep arguments from being resolved. When arguments go unresolved, they build up and lead to emotional disconnection.
      Resentment Reduction THerapy addresses this by having individuals complete the "Barriers to Resolving Conflicts Questionnaire".
      This helps the therapist quickly understand which behaviors cause individuals to give up, give in, or go off in some new
      direction. Resentment Reduction Theory believes that when a critical mass of resentment builds up between a couple,
      they start to disconnect emotionally and this leads to a cascade of problems
      ranging from affairs to starting to focus more on their kids, job, shopping or substance abuse.</p>
