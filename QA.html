                  <h4><strong>Q. What do you do?</strong></h4>
                  <p>I help people save their relationships by helping them to look at their
                  own behaviors and how this affects their relationship. This may mean any "resentment generating behavior"
                  including over-shopping, alcohol and substance abuse, being manipulative or controlling or any number of other
                  behaviors.</p>
                  <h4><strong>Q. What are your credentials?</strong></h4>
                  <p>I have a doctorate from Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan and I am a fully licensed psychologist
                  in Michigan. I have been doing couples counseling for over 25 years.</p>
                  <h4><strong>Q. Where are you located? Do you only work with local clients or do you work with people over
                  the phone too?</strong></h4>
                  <p>My office is located in Grand Rapids, MI, but I also work with clients on skype and over the phone.</p>
                  <h4><strong>Q. How are you different from other therapists?</strong></h4>
                  <p>There is no "one size fits all" solution to most couples' problems. However, in 90% of all cases,
                  there is usually emotional disconnection brought on by a buildup of resentment. I help clients to understand
                  where their resentment is coming from and what behaviors derail their arguments. No other therapist will
                  help you with this.</p>
                  <h4><strong>Q. How much does this cost?</strong></h4>
                  <p>Sessions cost $125.00 for 50 minutes. The average number of sessions that
                  couples need to resolve their marital problems is 5 or 6 sessions.</p>

                        <strong>How do we fall out of love?</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>1. When we find someone especially attractive, our brains produce neurotransmitters.
                    These brain chemicals make us feel like we are "high". We feel infatuation (but we think we are in love).</p>
                    <p>2. We don't really fall in love with our love interest, but rather their "representative" or part of them they
                    want us to see. If left uninterrupted by reality we start to have feelings for our lover. But the neurotransmitters
                    of love blind us to the true nature of our love interest.</p>
                    <p>3. If the person that we have these feelings for is at least 80% of the person they passed
                    themselves off as being, there is little if any resentment. If not, there tends to be a sense of
                    disconnection and betrayal once the neurotransmitters wear off (about a year). This means that there can be a
                    sense of "what happened to the guy/girl I fell in love with."</p>
                    <p>4. We will do almost anything to continue the delivery of these brain chemicals. These
                    chemicals are very powerful, so powerful that they trump even our natural tendencies. If we are private, we become
                    talkative.</p>
                    <p>5. We marry, we have children, we go on with life. Naturally, there are issues that we have to resolve. Issues
                    like parenting, sex, chores, spending...</p>
                    <p>6. If we have the ability to argue constructively and "stay in the ring", we resolve our issues
                      without too much resentment being generated. If we can't resolve our issues however, if our partners call us names,
                      interrupt us, bring up stuff from the past or threaten to leave us, what happens to the issue? What happens is we don't
                      resolve the issue, because our arguments get de-railed.</p>
                    <p>7. When issues are left unresolved they don't go away. We open up the basement door
                    and kick them down in the basement. They build up and become resentment. When the resentment
                    builds up to a critical mass we start to disconnect emotionally.</p>
                    <p>8. When we disconnect emotionally we no longer feel like our partner is filling our
                    cup emotionally. When this happens we look for things in our lives that do fill our cup.
                    We start to focus on things like our careers, our children, our hobbies. Things that drive us from
                    our partner, not closer.</p>
                    <p>9. When we feel that the trust and respect for our partners begins to wane, we start to ask ourselves "How much of my heart should
                      I be holding back. How much am I willing to be hurt if this does not work out?" This does not necessarily mean we are leaving,
                      but it may mean we fantasize about it or start to make plans... just in case.</p>
                    <p>10. We start to become guarded and not allow our partner into our inner world. The very things that drew us to our mate, the laughing,
                    joking, playing, sex and talking dry up, and we feel like roommates. We feel emotionally disconnected.</p>
